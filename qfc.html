              <p>For my visual communication and design final project, I was required to rebrand a company based in Washington,
                providing a mock-up of:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>a logo</li>
                  <li>a website</li>
                  <li>a set of posters</li>
                  <li>a paper document</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I chose to redesign QFC because I wanted to tackle on the challenge of rebranding for a large company. My vision for
                the QFC rebrand was to make QFC a <b>friendlier</b> and <b>modern</b> grocery store. Please view my work and design
                process below.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-5 pt-5 pb-3" id="process">Design Process</h5>
                <p class='header2'><b>Research</b></p>
                <p>My QFC rebrand started with research. I researched the current QFC brand as well as competing grocery stores such as
                  Target, Walmart, and Albertson's. I also looked for different inspirations and concepts. During this research phase
                  of two days, I brainstormed different concepts for my redesigns. Ultimately, I decided on rebranding to 'The Q' when
                  I found a
                  <a href='https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/qfc-may-re-brand-to-the-q/281-536261750'>King5 article</a> where
                  the president of QFC stated that QFC may rebrand to 'The Q'.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Identity</b></p>
                <p>For this project, I started by first coming up with a brand identity. My thinking was not for a subtle QFC rebrand
                  but a radical change into a friendly and modern grocery store. Looking at the competiting grocery stores such as
                  Walmart and Target who have evolved to become bigger and futuristic brands made me want to do the same for QFC. My
                  focus was friendly and modern so I committed to moving forward with minimalist, colorful designs. I wanted a brand
                  that was versatile like the recent rebranding of the Juventus soccer team.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Logo</b></p>
                <p>My first piece was the logo because the logo is the most essential piece of a new brand identity. Looking back at
                  the old QFC logo, the blue and yellow contrasting colors were not friendly and having the words "Quality Food Center"
                  under the "QFC" made it seem tacky. For my redesigned logo, I paid tribute to QFC by combining the blue and yellow
                  hues of the old logo into a friendly green and using 'the' as a crown like the old logo. I also paid tribute to
                  Washington by creating the image of a sun over a mountain for Mt. Rainier with the 'Q'.</p>
                  <div class="text-center">
                    <img class='w-25 rounded' src="theQlogo.PNG">
                    <img class='w-25 rounded mx-5' src="qfc.svg">
                  </div>
                  <img class='img-fluid w-50 mx-auto d-block' src="theQlogos.png">
                  <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>Website</b></p>
                  <p>Redoing the QFC website was difficult because there was not a lot to use from the current QFC's website. The
                  current QFC website is very uniform and bland. Since QFC is owned by Kroger, the QFC website was identical to Fred
                  Meyer's and all other Kroger project stores' websites. Since my project was near the end of spring, the QFC website was
                  advertising summer sales and deals. I chose vibrant colors and images to create a summer feel. The website layout was
                  designed to be easily navigated. My font for the websites were chosen for their readability and welcoming nature.</p>
                  <img id="myImg0" src="theQwebsite-02.png" alt='Website Redesign' class='img-fluid w-25 shadow rounded mx-auto d-block'>
                  <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>Poster</b></p>
                  <p>The constraints for the posters were that they had to be 24x36 inches and had to include 3 different products the
                    company had. I decided to create a set of posters that would be posted on the walls of the Q, each with a different
                    'product'. Since it was hard for me to narrow down three signature QFC products, I addressed unique QFC elements with
                    a rewards card poster, employment poster, and signature brand poster. </p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                      <img id="myImg" src="theQbigposter-01.png" alt='Rewards Card Poster' class='img-fluid w-25 shadow'>
                      <img id="myImg2" src="theQbigposter-02.png" alt='Employee Recruiting Poster' class='img-fluid w-25 shadow mx-4'>
                      <img id="myImg3" src="theQbigposter-03.png" alt='Signature Brand Poster' class='img-fluid w-25 shadow'>
                    </div>
                  <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>Document</b></p>
                  <p>The document needed to be an 8.5x11 inch document showing various levels of hierarchy. For this, I created a recipe
                    flyer for customers to grab inside the stores.</p>
                  <img id="myImg4" src="theQpostercomp.png" alt='Recipe Flyer' class='img-fluid w-25 shadow rounded mx-auto d-block'>
              <h5 class="mt-5 pt-5" id="reflect">Reflection</h5>
              <p>Looking back on this project, it was very fun. I loved being able to take an existing company and putting my own spin on it. I had to be careful in keeping important history while incorporating new, modern elements to the company's visual language. This project required a lot of thinking about small details which I love. I learned how nuanced and complex the reputations of companies are. Going forward, I have a greated understanding of brand creation which will help me in my next design projects.</p>
