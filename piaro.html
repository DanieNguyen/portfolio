              <p>At the Dubhacks 2018 Hackathon, we had to design anything that is for social good, so I created Piaro. Piaro is a mobile messaging application that automatically translates messages allowing people who speak different languages to communicate with one another. Piaro allows: 
                <ul>
                  <li>people from different parts of the world to connect like pen pals</li>
                  <li>people staying in a foreign place (such as refugees and immigrants) to communicate with their new community</li>
                  <li>travelers who are curious to find out information directly from a citizen</li>
                </ul>
                I came up with this idea, using personal experience of not being able to communicate with my grand parents and knowledge from my Project ARTogether internship. I led a team of two other software developers to implement my idea using the Google Translation API and together, we have created a high fidelity mockup. Please check out my design process below and play with the interactive mockup! I also created a presentation website <a href="uyeda.me/Piaro">here.</a></p>

                <p class='header2'><b>Ideation</b></p>
                <p>Since this project was created at the Dubhacks Hackathon, it was one of many ideas that my team brainstormed. As I said above, my inspiration for this idea came from my knowledge of refugees in America from the Project ARTogether internship. For refugees in San Francisco, it is hard to connect to those around them because of a language barrier. I, myself have problems communicating with my grandparents as well because they only speak Vietnamese and not English. This was a social issue that I felt needed to be tackled and could be tackled with the time constraints of a hackathon.</p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Designing</b></p>
                <p>Because of the time constraints, I was unable to do user research on this project. I went right into designing the information architecture and wireframes for the idea. However, as I was working, I was exploring paths about how to make the interface with my team and making sure that people of all areas could easily navigate it. I tried as much as possible to put myself in the shoes of a potential user while designing. Since it was all on the fly, I kept having to add more wireframes. Initially, I was only going for around 10 basic screens, but I was constantly adding more because of possible user interactions I saw. I ended up with 44 wireframes that detail all the possible interactions in our application.</p>
                <p class="font-italic my-3" id="feat">Features</p>
                <p class="mb-3">While designing the wireframes, I kept in mind three key features that I wanted to implement. I wanted to make sure the translation was instant, users would have recommened friends, and that users could easily search and add new friends. These three features would ensure that Piaro could work for those who need pen pals, help talking to their neighbors, and information from a certain area. Below are the descriptions and functionality of these features.</p>
                <div class="container col-11 mt-3">
                  <p class="font-italic mt-3">Instant Translation
                  </p>
                  <p class="mt-3 mb-3">Users have the options of setting their default language that all their incoming messages
                    will be translated to. No manual translations needed! However, users can view the original text by tapping and
                    holding on the message if they would like.
                  </p>
                  <div class="container text-center mb-5">
                    <img class="w-25 mr-5" src="1.png">
                    <img class="w-25 ml-5" src="2.png">
                  </div>
                  <p class="font-italic my-3">Friends
                  </p>
                  <p class="mt-3 mb-3">Users will be matched to recommended friends on their home feed. These friends are found
                    based on the information from the user quiz (which is retakeable) and user profiles. These new pals will always have
                    something in common with you!
                  </p>
                  <div class="container text-center mb-5">
                    <img class="w-25 mr-5" src="4.png">
                    <img class="w-25 ml-5" src="5.png">
                  </div>
                  <p class="font-italic my-3">Search
                  </p>
                  <p class="mt-3 mb-3">Users can easily search for other users, using a phone number, 4 digit ID number, or city.
                    This way, if you want to talk to someone you already know with a language barrier, you can with Piaro. For travelers
                    who want to know the best places to go in a certain city, Piaro can definitely help.
                  </p>
                  <div class="container text-center mb-5">
                    <img class="w-25 mr-5" src="3.png">
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p class="header2"><b>User Testing</b></p>
                <p>At the Dubhacks competition, despite not being about to do user research, I was able to do user testing with mentors from technology companies. I learned a lot about the nuances I needed to consider including the translation aspects of our application. I was able to improve my designs to make it more usable for the global users, by incorporating pictures and clear icons. </p>
                <p class='header2'><b>Software Development</b></p>
                <p>While I focused on the designs of Piaro, my team members were working on the back end of the project. They were figuring out how to utilize the Google Translation API and connect it to a messaging application. During their work, I was assisting them by clarifying the specific features and functionality of Piaro.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-5 pt-5" id='reflect'>Reflection</h5>
              <p>Creating Piaro in a little under 11 hours was very challenging. However, it was super enjoyable because of the fast pace that I was working at. Unfortunately, we were not able to create a finished prototype at the competition, but it is definitely being worked still! I hope to do testing with target users once we have a working prototype and continue to add to Piaro.</p>
