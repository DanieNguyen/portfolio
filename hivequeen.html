              <p>For my user-centered design course, I worked in a team of 4 in order to create a user-centered product for urban
                beekeepers. Our product focuses on helping beekeepers:</p>
      
                <ul>
                  <li>Monitor their bees remotely</li>
                  <li>Maintain beehive health factors</li>
                  <li>Record important beehive statistics</li>
                  <li>Continue beekeeping with inexpensive costs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our team went through the full user-centered design process to create Hive Queen. Please view a shortened version of
                our work and design process below. For the full write-up, please click this <a href='https://daniespam26.wixsite.com/huxney'

              <h5 class="mt-5 pt-5 pb-3" id="process">Design Process</h5>
                <p class='header2'><b>User Research</b></p>
                <p>For this project, our team chose a user group that none of us were familiar with in order to eliminate existing
                  bias. We chose beekeepers randomly and conducted in-depth interviews with four different beekeepers. Using this
                  information, we created user personas, story boards, and user journey maps to identify and evaluate the different
                  pain points that beekeepers currently have. After four weeks of research, our team started to think of solutions
                  through brainstorming and focusing on our decided design requirements.</p>

                <img id="myImg4" src="journeymap.png" alt='Recipe Flyer' class='img-fluid w-75 shadow rounded mx-auto d-block'>
                <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>Prototyping</b></p>
                <p>For the next two weeks, we focused on prototyping and wireframing. Our chosen solution was a physical hive
                  monitoring system connected to a mobile application for beekeepers to use. This combination would allow beekeepers
                  to easily overcome their pain points of not being able to check on their beehives due to location or weather. Our
                  team used paper prototypes and Figma to draw our mobile application and hive system.</p>
                <img id="myImg4" src="paperpro.PNG" alt='Recipe Flyer' class='img-fluid w-75 shadow rounded mx-auto my-3 d-block'>
                <img id="myImg4" src="physproto.PNG" alt='Recipe Flyer' class='img-fluid w-25 shadow rounded mx-auto d-block'>
                <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>Usability Testing</b></p>
                <p>Then after creating our prototypes, we had to conduct user testing in order to make sure our product was actually
                  good for the users. Although, we did not have time to test with beekeepers themselves, we managed to test with a variety of college students. We found out through first impressions and task walk-throughs that our mobile application could
                  be madae more efficient and simpler. Our team realized we were trying to add too many features that took away from
                  the purpose of the hive system. Thanks to the user testing, we revised our designs and then created high fidelity
                  mock-ups.</p>
                <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>High Fidelity Mock-Ups</b></p>
                <p>Our high fidelity mock-ups for the mobile application were made in Figma, with 22 different screens, and the
                  physical hive monitoring system was designed in Solidworks and 3D printed. These mock-ups took a week to design.
                  The last part of the project was presenting it to various companies in order to see if it was something that they
                  would sponsor. We created a presentation using the high fidelity mock-ups and ended with a 100% rate of support for
                  our project.</p>
                  <div class="text-center">
                    <img class='w-50 rounded' src="hive.png">
                    <img class='w-50 rounded' id="reflect" src="physical.PNG">
                  </div>
                  <h5 class="mt-5 pt-5">Reflection</h5>
              <p>Looking back on this project, it was definitely difficult to thoroughly create a product in just nine weeks. I wish we would have had time to schedule user testing with beekeepers themselves to see how effective and feasible our product would be for them. I also would have liked more time to create higher fidelity mockups. But, this project was a great learning experience that taught me the time constraints of research and testing in industry that I will have to face.</p>
