                <p>For my user-centered design course, I worked in a team of 4 in order to create a user-centered product for urban
                  beekeepers. After conducting research with beekeepers, our team found that many beekeepers struggle with dedicating
                  time to their
                  multiple beehives efficiently, especially in the winter. They were also worried about noticing and responding to
                  threats like diseases to their hives. With these beekeeping pain points in mind, our team designed a mobile,
                  intuitive
                  monitoring system. Our product focuses on helping beekeepers:</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li>Monitor their bees remotely</li>
                  <li>Maintain beehive health factors</li>
                  <li>Record important beehive statistics</li>
                  <li>Continue beekeeping with inexpensive costs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our team went through the full user-centered design process to create Hive Queen. Please view a shortened version of
                  our work and design process below. For the full write-up, please click this <a href='https://daniespam26.wixsite.com/huxney'

                <p><b>User Research</b> | Four Weeks</p>
                <p>For this project, our team chose a user group that none of us were familiar with in order to eliminate existing
                  bias. We chose beekeepers randomly and conducted in-depth interviews with four different beekeepers. Using this
                  information, we created two user personas based on the two important types of beekeepers we identified to evaluate
                  the different
                  pain points that beekeepers currently have. We then used those personas to create a user journey map to further
                  empathize with the different emotions that beekeepers feel when interacting with their hive. After four weeks of
                  research, our team started to think of solutions
                  through brainstorming and focusing on our decided design requirements.</p>

                <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>Design Requirements</b> | One Week</p>
                <p class="mb-5">Using the information from our research, we came up with a list of design requirements that we wanted
                  to address with our solution. Using these design requirements, each team member created two storyboards with
                  different solutions for our design requirements. We discussed these solutions as a team and decided which one we
                  would use. Our chosen solution was a physical hive monitoring system connected to a mobile application for beekeepers
                  to use. This combination would allow beekeepers to easily overcome their pain points of not being able to check on
                  their beehives due to location or weather. <br><br> After choosing a solution, our team focused on the information
                  architecture of the application and hive monitoring system before designing prototypes. We wanted to make sure users
                  can easily access information and that the hierarchy of the information made sense. Using this information
                  architecture map, our team created paper prototypes and Figma to draw our mobile application and hive system.</p>
                <p class='header2 mt-5'><b>Prototyping </b> | One Week</p>
                <p class="mb-5">For the next week, we focused on creating prototypes and wireframes. We focused on creating low
                  fidelity prototypes, using pencil and paper for both the mobile application and hive monitoring system. These
                  prototypes were meant for us to conduct usability testing with. </p>

                <p class='mt-5'><b>Usability Testing</b> | One Week</p>
                <p>Then after creating our prototypes, we had to conduct user testing in order to make sure our product was actually
                  working how we intended it to for the users. Although we could not schedule testing with beekeepers themselves, we
                  managed to test with a variety of college students. Our team had testers conduct three different tasks while thinking
                  out loud that each had a variety of steps to complete. We took notes and we found out through first impressions and
                  task walk-throughs that our mobile application could be made more efficient and simpler. Our team realized we were
                  trying to add too many features that took away from the purpose of the hive system. Thanks to the user testing, we
                  revised our designs and then created high fidelity
                  mock-ups.</p>
                <p class='mt-5'><b>High Fidelity Mock-Ups</b> | Two Weeks</p>
                <p>Our high fidelity mock-ups for the mobile application were made in Figma, with 22 different screens, and the
                  physical hive monitoring system was designed in Solidworks and 3D printed. These mock-ups took a week to design. The
                  last part of the project was presenting it to various companies in order to see if it was something that they would
                  sponsor. We created a presentation detailing our design process and ended with a 100% rate of support for our
                  project.</p>

            <p>Looking back on this project, it was definitely difficult to thoroughly create a product in just nine weeks.
              However, it was a great learning experience for our team. We learned a lot about the user centered design process as
              well as the beekeeping process. It was great to bond together as complete strangers and collaborate as a team over a
              long-term project. <br><br>Throughout the process, there were some moments where I felt that we were a little rushed
              and were not able to do exactly what we wanted. For the usability testing, I wish we would have had time to schedule
              user testing with beekeepers themselves to see how effective and feasible our product would be for them. I also would
              have liked more time to create higher fidelity mockups. But, these issues were great learning experiences as well
              that taught me the time constraints of research and testing in industry that I will have to face.</p>
